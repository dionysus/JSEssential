                <p>They were not composed altogether of flesh and blood. 
                    They had shape but that shape was not made of matter. 
                    When the stars were right, They could plunge from world to 
                    world through the sky; but when the stars were wrong, They 
                    could not live. But although They no longer lived, They 
                    would never really die. They all lay in stone houses in 
                    Their great city of R'lyeh, preserved by the spells of 
                    mighty Cthulhu for a glorious resurrection when the stars 
                    and the earth might once more be ready for Them.</p>
